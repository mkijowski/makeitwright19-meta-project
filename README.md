### Make IT Wright 2019 META project

Welcome to the Make IT Wright 2019 hackathon!  This is an example project that
myself (Matt Kijowski) and hopefully a few others find interesting and will be
our informal submission to this challenge (not to be officially judged, but so I
have an example for next year).

### Objectives

Basic outline will be to develop code/scripts/etc for automating a generic
hackathon environment for participants to use to get off the ground.  First
round of brainstorming brought the following goals:

* Automatic gituhub repository creation via `curl -u 'mkijowski'
  https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{"name":"EXAMPLE-REPO"}'`
* Automatically add users to above repo?
* IRC via AWS?
* Pomodoro timer integration?
* Visual Studio Code integration scripts/setup?
* instructions?
* AWS IOT button integration
* Github/IRC issue tracking?
* IRC bot?
* automated emails of IP and repo information?
* AWS supercomputer deployment (slurm)

All of these are not likely in todays time frame so I will be prioritizing soon
and implementing based on priority.

### Current state
Well, I have a lot of old github repositories and a couple of AWS IOT buttons...
And a corgi, so life is good.
